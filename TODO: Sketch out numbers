TODO: Sketch out numbers
1. Give people sliders for how much they expect sharing economy to decrease labor and decrease capital costs.
Behind the scenes, weight each for the fraction of the total economy that they consist of. As a simplifying assumption at first, perhaps assume every industry has the same capital:labor cost ratio?
Y = A (E_k * K)^alpha (E_l * L)^(1-alpha)
Alpha: .3
Decreasing labor costs by X is the same as increasing the amount of labor by 1/(1-x). The sliders that people control will affect E_l and E_k, which are the efficiency of labor and capital respectively.
So if you expect average labor costs to halve, then you expect the total amount of effective labour to double.
Furthermore, there will be a knock-on effect, because increased spending increases investment.
In non-equilibrium environment, caused by growth, unemployment will fall and inflation will increase. Expected that half of GDP growth decreases inflation.

From T1 to T10, shift E_k and E_l from 1 to new values by 10% of given amount. In starting state, Investment is a fixed proportion p1 of Y, and depreciation is a fixed percentage p2 of K.

change_in_k(Y, K):
	return Y*p1-K*p2

Y(K,L,E_k,E_l, alpha=.3):
	return (E_k * K)**.26 (E_l * L)**.74

p1 for the US is estimated at 12.8% (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_gross_fixed_investment_as_percentage_of_GDP)
