	Abstract: We agree that "ethical subjectivism means any view could be right." Russ seems to interpret this to think that "any view is right." I argue that most views are wrong, in the sense that they do not accurately reflect people's moral desires given reflection.

	Russ argues, and bolds, a few problems with ethical subjectivism that I will address in turn. Firstly, Russ argues that, under ethical subjectivism (hereafter abbreviated ES), we are stuck with moral equivalence. "Everyone's ultimate moral views are as plausible as everyone else's . . . we lose our basis for issuing substantive moral criticism of unsavory characters such as Nazis and terrorists. . . . we can criticize the views of Nazis and terrorists, but only from our own perspective. Importantly, our perspective is not superior to theirs. . . . It is likely to leave us cold in the face of serious evil."

	Secondly, Russ argues that "Normative subjectivism comes very close to rendering each person morally infallible. An infallible person is one who cannot make mistakes. Thus such a person has no false beliefs and all true ones. If subjectivism is true, then it is possible that all, or almost all, of our moral beliefs are correct. We can be morally mistaken in only one of two ways. We might base our moral views on false beliefs .  . . we might possess moral beliefs that conflict with other, deeper moral beliefs we already hold."

	Response:

	It is on this second point that Russ is almost entirely wrong, and the wrongness of his second point explains and reveals the wrongness of the first. If subjectivism is true, and all my factual beliefs about the external world are correct, and all my beliefs about my own beliefs are correct, then I am morally infallible. Russ seems to think that this happens, ever. I contend that it does not. Firstly, we frequently equivocate, are uncertain about, and even change our moral views. I would wager that Russ has changed his mind about the rightness of at least one thing over the course of his life, through the traditional process of thought experiments, exposure of logical contradictions, and simple shifts in sentiment. To pick one example, most of my family wants me to die. Oh, not right away, of course, they don't want me to die now, or even in ten years. But eventually, they want me to lose my mental and physical capabilities and then cease to exist. I have convinced some of them that this is bad, and now some of my family does not want me to die. I didn't do this by disagreeing over the facts, but by asking people to consider scenarios and situations, and knowing that these situations and scenarios considered would have a high likelihood of pushing them to change their view about the goodness of my losing everything I valued for myself. If this strikes you as plausible, that I could convince a significant fraction of people of something, not by challenging their factual beliefs but by having them consider their moral feelings on certain issues, then you agree that we are far from morally infallible.

	So if Russ is wrong that people are morally infallible, what does this suggest about Nazis and terrorists? If I believed the factual claims "terrorism is a succesful tactic for driving colonizers/invaders such as the British out", and "Driving the British out of Ireland would be extremely good for Ireland and the people of Ireland" with sufficient confidence, and had the moral belief "it is right and proper to value the Irish people over the British" then I would sign up with the IRA. This suggests to me that if I could speak with an IRA member, and convince them that terrorism is an ineffective tactic, that the British occupying your country may be bad but their leaving is worse (perhaps with India or a quarter of Africa as examples), and that it is morally wrong to value the lives and happiness of Irish people above the lives of British people, I think that I could convince the IRA member to leave. A similar argument could be had with a Nazi: "The Jews do not have an international conspiracy to destroy the German race", "This is how biology and inheritance actually works, please stop sterilizing people with non-genetic illnesses", "war is not, generally speaking, good for participating countries".

	There is still the open question of "can I convince an IRA member that valuing Irish lives more than British lives is wrong." Empirically, I can't convince most Americans that valuing American lives over Kenyan lives is wrong, as evidenced by my continued failure to convert everybody I know to Effective Altruism

	Russ then suggests that opposed true moral views generate contradictions if viewed as expressing absolute truth, and says that the ES proponents can solve this by understanding opinions as being true iff they reflect what an individual would believe given all the relevant facts and arguments. He then claims, however, that this leaves "subjectivism incapable of explaining the point or existence of moral disagreement." He also states that "we lose incentive to continue moral conversation, because moral truth just consists in reports of personal feelings. . . . Disagreement cannot focus on whether famine relief is <i>really</i> right, right in a non-relative, objective sense . . . subjectivism elaves us with an entirely unrecognizable picture of moral disagreement."

	Response:

	As I've discussed, moral disagreement consists of much more than simply reporting personal feelings. People disagree over factual claims, and frequently attempt to convince the other person of those factual claims. People further disagree over values, and try to express this by

	Russ argues, as "a final concern", that "our moral views are arbitrary": "there is no better reason to adopt one ethical view over another. . .  the reasons that support a moral belief may fail entirely to move other informed, rational, good-willed people. In this sense, one's views are arbitrary, because they are supported by reasons that could, with complete propriety, be rejected by and and all other rational people."

	Funnily enough, what Russ describes as a nightmare, I observe. "My child matters more" is not a universally compelling argument, yet people act on it regularly with respect to their own children. "informed, rational, good-willed people", could perhaps, be defined very strongly: they must know all the relevant facts, have considered all the moral arguments and examples and counter-examples, and have a sincere desire to do the most good possible. Perhaps there are a handful of issues on which such people could disagree: the morality of sibling incest not resulting in children, for example. Yet it seems the greatest moral crises of our time depend on either facts (do souls exist in fetus'?), lack of rationality (most people put very little effort into investigating the relative impact of diffferent charities that they could be donating to.), or lack of good will (starvation in a world of plenty).
