			<ul>
				<li>If the universe is probabilistic, deriving certainty about the world is impossible.</li>
				<li>We can't know if we are in a simulation, indeed, there's a decent likelihood we are in one.</li>
				<li>So, why should we bother trying to define 'knowledge' in relation to reality?</li>
				<li>Instead, it's better to reference the one thing we can be relatively confident about:</li>
				<li>Our own internal experiences. "I expect this experience with this probability" is one of three types of meaningful statements.</li>
				<li>The other two are deductive statements of any sort and "I oberve this about my mental state."</li>
				<li>It is possible to be deductive and wrong: I've gotten plenty of geometry proofs wrong.</li>
				<li>It is possible to be introspective and wrong.</li>
				<li></li>

			<ul>
				<li>We're probably in a simulation. Having my ethics work in the reality I experience is a plus.</li>
				<li>As a consequence, I reject Nozick's experience machine: why is two levels of simulation worse than one?</li>
				<li>I would also reject it even if we weren't in a simulation.</li>
				<li>I'm a hedonist. I think pleasure is good.</li>
				<li>I'm not some wirehead wannabe: I want to experience a variety of pleasures.</li>
				<li>I'm a total utilitarian, considered over the course of the universe.</li>
				<li>I'm also a rule utilitarian, in the service of my act-utilitarianism.</li>
				<li>We are imperfect and flawed beings, and ignoring this leads to trouble.</li>
