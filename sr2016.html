<p>Scenes from the 2016 campaign</p><p>"Sir, you want to ask Captain FUCKING America to be your running mate? You haven't even won the nomination yet!"<br>The senator looked at his campaign manager seriously. "Sarah, you've seen our poll numbers. We need something if we're going to beat her, and he just might be it."<br>Most of the rest of the table was silent. His wife hadn't reattached her jaw to her mouth yet.<br>"We had talked about getting a moderate, to help appeal the average American. Maybe even a liberal Republican."<br>"Captain America is a national hero. You think that the Iowan primary voter respects any politician, left or right, more than he respects Steve Rogers?"<br>"He's a bisexual socialist who regularly pisses off everyone right of, well, you. His immigration positions alone..."<br>"So do I."<br>"I thought we were going for diversity?"<br>"We've never had a bisexual VP before."<br>"Ok. I'll talk with him. But I still want Snowe, you understand?"<br>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
"I'm not a politician."<br>"You know your history as well as I do: when has the VP been an effective politician?"<br>"Martin van Buren, and I've read good things about Johnson's record."<br>"Both of whom later became president. I don't think that's your plan."<br>"No, it's not. To be honest, I'm only hear because I do plan to stump for you."<br>"The VP stumps better than anyone. You're also harder to kill than most, making you an excellent choice for a backup. You've got immense national and international prestige: did you ever think before you fell asleep that you'd walk into Berlin a feted hero?"<br>"Most of the senate hates me: I tend to piss those with power off."<br>"If I wanted a compromiser, I'd get Snowe. I want someone with moral force and legitimacy."<br>"That's part of what I'm worried about. I'm supposed to be a national icon: how will I be able to push for good if you were outed in a scandal?"<br>"I won't deny that it's a risk. But how could you turn down the chance to push for good from the inside?"<br>"I'll talk with my team. If Natasha finds any dirt on you, it's off. If you ever tell me what to say, I'll ignore you. But I'm willing to listen on when to say it, and I do want to see you president."
<br>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
"Well?"<br>"When did he take over running the ground campaign?"<br>"This man has led teams and inspired troops through ridiculously hostile territory for decades. Who better to run our operations in Texas? Plus, if anyone shoots him, he'll heal."<br>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
"ROGERS!" The beleaguered cry of his PR manager generally comes first. It would be convenient if he could shut his mouth. That said, they were ahead in the polls, and the boosts in funding from his existence weren't bad.<br>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
Nat, when did you get so good at hiding money like this?<br>Look, rich boy, you were the one who wanted to support a goddam socialist who thinks you should retire the suit. I'm doing this for you, not for him.

"What the hell are you doing with that clustering model? You're going to get errors for any sample size under 20, and you know how finely we're slicing some of the demographics. You know what, screw this, let me push some of the code I wrote for gamma ray detection. Treat it like a black box, I'll get better numbers in less cluster time while conforming to the API you've already got."
<br>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
The presidential debate was a brilliant performance of fire. Who won tended to depend mostly on the political opinions you had going in, with both giving eloquent portrayals of very different realities. The Vice-Presidential debate, well. Jindal was brilliant: he did his Masters at Oxford on a Rhodes. But Steve had trained his nerves under fire, learned to memorize battle plans in a moment (and his speechwriters were so thankful he was willing to memorize the lines that he approved of, and read enough Safire to make eloquent the ones he insisted on improvising), and he mopped the floor with him. It was an unkind comment that people were going to vote Sanders/Rogers in the hopes of premature death. It wasn't always false.<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br>It was a pity, really, that they still lost when election day came around. Advertising money matters.</p>
