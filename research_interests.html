			<ul>
				<li>One of the strongest findings in the international relations literature is Democratic Peace Theory.</li>
				<li>Democracies don't go to war with each other.</li>
				<li>To end war, one might suggest, simply make all countries democracies.</li>
				<li>Experience has taught Americans in Iraq and Afghanistan that this is easier said than done.</li>
				<li>But China is learning that it is hard to have a developed economy, with access to the internet, and non-democratic rule.</li>
				<li>I'm not sure if Democratic Peace Theory will hold for democracies created via economic development.</li>
				<li>It seems the best hope for world peace anyone has known for a long time.</li>

			<ul>
				<li>Population ethics is one of the trickier branches of modern philosophy, and is to a certain extent unsolved.</li>
				<li>There is no position that doesn't entail biting some uncomfortable bullets, or using ad hoc measures to avoid them.</li>
				<li>Solving all of population ethics in my spare time would be a little ambitious.</li>
				<li>I want to come up with a workable way to integrate the problems and knowledge of population ethics into normative political theory.</li>
				<li>This would focus largely on the position of children, parents, and the relative distribution of positive and negative rights.</li>
